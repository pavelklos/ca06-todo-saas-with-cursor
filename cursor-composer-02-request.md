I want you to propose a step by step plan to add functionality to the Base plan. I do not want you to propose code changes yet, only a step by step plan so only once we have confirmed that one small achievable step works as expected we can proceed with the next small achievable step.

The step by step plan I want you to create is in order to add to the Base plan subscribers the ability manage To-Do lists for a team so:

- Subscribers with owner role can create a new to-do task.
- Subscribers with owner or member role can see the list of to-do tasks.
- Subscribers with owner or member role can update one particular to-do task.
- Subscribers with owner or member role can delete one particular to-do task.

Remember that the template is set-up with a existing configuration for Postgres. Implement all the functionality in the flow above while using the existing codebase as a starting point, but fully modify the codebase to fit the flow and functionality described above.

I want you to propose a step by step plan so we can go to the next step once we have confirmed that the previous step works as expected.
