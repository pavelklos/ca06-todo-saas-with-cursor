If you work on big projects or multiple projects, `pnpm` is more efficient; otherwise, `npm` works fine for simpler needs. "

    "    * select postgres 17.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **pooled connection** is like a shortcut or efficient way for your application to connect to the database. Here's a simple explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normal Connections:** Normally, every time your application talks to the database, it has to create a new connection. This takes time and uses up resources on both your application and the database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Connection Pooling:** Instead of creating a new connection every time, a \"pool\" of reusable connections is created. When your app needs to talk to the database, it just grabs one of these pre-made connections from the pool. After itâ€™s done, the connection is returned to the pool for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why is it recommended for serverless/edge environments?**\n",
    "   - **Serverless environments (like Vercel or AWS Lambda):** These spin up new instances of your app frequently, often for every request. Without pooling, each instance would create and close database connections repeatedly, which can overwhelm the database.\n",
    "   - **Edge environments:** These are distributed globally and often handle many small, fast requests. Pooled connections make this more efficient because they reduce the time and resources needed to establish connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "By selecting the **pooled connection** option, your app uses a connection pooling service (usually managed by Neon) to handle connections more efficiently, especially when running in environments like serverless or edge computing setups.\n",
