    "#### Full-Stack Todo App Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "This is a todo list application with two main parts:\n",
    "1. Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)\n",
    "2. Frontend (Next.js)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Does It Do?\n",
    "- Users can create, view, edit, and delete todo items\n",
    "- Each todo item has:\n",
    "  - A name (the task description)\n",
    "  - A completion status (done/not done)\n",
    "  - An ID (automatically assigned)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Backend (FastAPI)\n",

    "   - Connect to backend API\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Deployment**:\n",
    "   - Backend: Deploy to Render.com\n",
    "   - Frontend: Deploy to Vercel\n",
    "   - Configure environment variables\n",
    "   - Set up CORS for production\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Technical Features\n",
    "1. **Database Management**:\n",
    "   - Uses Alembic for database migrations\n",
    "   - SQLAlchemy for database operations\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Authentication\n",
    "- Auth logic goes in `lib/auth/`\n",
    "- Use middleware for protected routes\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Documentation\n",
    "- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions\n",
    "- Document props with TypeScript interfaces\n",
    "- Keep README files updated\n",

    "- Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations\n",
    "- Define schemas in `lib/db/schema.ts`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Authentication\n",
    "- Auth logic goes in `lib/auth/`\n",
    "- Use middleware for protected routes\n",
    "- Handle sessions via cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Routes\n",
    "- Keep API routes in `app/api/`\n",
    "- Use server actions for form submissions\n",

    "throw new Error('Friendly error message');\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment Variables\n",
    "- Store in `.env.local` for development\n",
    "- Never commit `.env` files\n",
    "- Use strong typing for env variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing Standards\n",
    "- Place tests next to the component: `Component.test.tsx`\n",
    "- Use meaningful test descriptions\n",
    "- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documentation\n",
    "- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions\n",
    "- Document props with TypeScript interfaces\n",
    "- Keep README files updated\n",
    "- Comment complex business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git Practices\n",
    "- Use meaningful commit messages\n",
    "- Create feature branches from main\n",
    "- Follow conventional commits format\n",
    "- Review code before merging\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Considerations\n",
    "- Use Next.js Image component for images\n",

    "- Use React Suspense boundaries\n",
    "- Optimize database queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: This template follows Next.js 13+ conventions with the App Router and Server Components. Always consider whether a component needs to be client-side before adding 'use client' directive."
